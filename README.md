I'm @MrDevel0per, and I love all things Swift and SwiftUI. I do some ML/AI work as well as Unity + C# game development. This profile has some of my work, but most of my projects are in @OCA-Creations repos, my development company. See https://github.com/OCA-Creations for more! Some of my favorite projects so far (most are still in development):
## [Ally](https://github.com/OCA-Creations/Ally)
I love using the terminal (even more now thanks to iTerm2), but I didn't love managing aliases - writing them manually to a .zshrc seemed inefficient, and I often will be using several terminal sessions, so I wanted something that _persists_. Enter Ally. I think of it as my ZSH tool that's always on my side (an Ally, for short). It manages my aliases and makes adding and removing new ones a breeze. The status chart:
  - **Development Status:** Active Development
  - **Reliability:** Not Fully Tested
  - **Version:** Pre-Alpha (not yet released).

# Learning
🌱 I’m currently learning Tensorflow, Firebase, Python, and more Swift.
